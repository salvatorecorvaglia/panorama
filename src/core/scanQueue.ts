/**
 * Coalescing for scan requests.
 *
 * Several things ask for a refresh — activation, the file watcher, the periodic
 * timer, three commands and the webview — and they can easily overlap. Running
 * a scan per request would walk the workspace several times over; dropping the
 * extra requests would leave a caller with a stale view.
 *
 * The subtlety this exists to capture: two scans are not interchangeable. An
 * offline scan cannot answer a request for registry data, so handing one back
 * to "Check for Updates" makes the command appear to do nothing at all.
 *
 * Kept free of `vscode` so that rule can be tested directly.
